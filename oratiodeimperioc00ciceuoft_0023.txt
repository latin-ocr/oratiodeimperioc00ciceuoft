In B.C. 69 Pompey retii-ed into private life, and took no active
part in politics till 13.c. 67 when the Lex Gabinia conferred upon
him the command against the pirates.

Τ lte Pirates.

16. Piracy had long been a curse in the Mediterranean:
it was the proti-acted misrule of the Roman Govemment that
allowed it to grow into a political power.

The head-quarters of the pirate—chiefs were in Cilicia and
Crete, and during the troubled years of revolution and civil war
these countries served as a shelter alike to the desperado and
the hunted refugee. We find the pirates plundering Samos and
Clazomenae under the eyes of Sulla, in defiance of his army
and fleet; they figure as the allies of Mithridates and of the
Roman democrats in exile.

The commerce of the Mediterranean was wholly in their
power. Merchants and even troops destined for the East had
to choose between the danger of capture and that of sailing
during the winter-season when the seas were closedl. Many
Romans of rank, among them Julius Caesar, were captured and
compelled to pay a heavy ransom. History records no other
system of brigaudage so vast and so well organized. At last
⁷ their depredations extended to the shores of Italy; the Appian
way itself was unsafe2; a fieet equipped against them was
destroyed in the port of Ostia³; two praetors with their retinues,
lictors, fasces and all, were carried off into captivity4. Their
control of the seas threatened the capital, which subsisted on
imported corn, with all the horrors of a famine.
