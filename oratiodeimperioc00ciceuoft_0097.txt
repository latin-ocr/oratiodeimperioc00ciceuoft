noticed, and it should be remembered that the pers. subj. like the
perf. ind. is both an aorist and a primary tense, thus rogo quid fecerit
may mean ‘ I ask what he did‚' or ‘ I ask what he has done.'
ιο venti: in 40, l. 9 where Cicero is praising Pompey’s personat
merit, not his good fortune, the help of the winds is disclaimed.
η qul: see note on 37, l. 1 1 : the qui here is consecutive, ‘so
presumptuous as to ....... ’
13 optare: see note on 25, 1. 293 tacitus has a special force, men
osten cherish in silence wishes they would not venture to express
aloud. Cf. Hor. Ep. 1, 16, 59
Iane pater! clare, clare cum dixit, Apollo!
Labra movet metuens audiri: ‘ Pulchra Laverna,
Da mihi fallere, da iusto sanctoque videri)

For tacitus cf. 13, 1. 15.

¹5 proprium ac perpetuum: ‘his own for ever-’3 in 32,1. 16 proprius
takes the genitive.

cum...tum: see note on 6, 1. α.

16 sicuti facitis: ‘as you are doing‚' referring to velle et optare.
Cicero knows that the sympathies of the people are with him.

49 19 accuratissime: ‘with the utmost care‚’ not ‘accuracy.'

22 dubitatis...qu1n: the infinitive is more usual. As a rule dubitare
in the sense of ‘to hesitate ’ takes an infinitive construction in
negative clauses. The interrogative here expects the answer ‘no‚'
and therefore implies a negative.

hoc tantum boni: ‘this great advantage,’ moening the possession
os a general qui ad omnia nostrae memoriae bella cotficienda divino
quodam consilio natus esse videtur.

23 in: ad is more usual with conferre.

50 26 erat deligendus: ‘would have had to be chosen.’ Verbs and
expressions denoting necessity, duty, possibility when used in the
apodosis of a conditional clause that is contrary to sact, are put in
the past indicative instead of the subjunctive.

27 nune: ‘as it is!

28 opportunitas: ‘fortunate circumstance?

ut: follows adiungatur on the analogy os accedit.
3¹ cetera: not bella but quae commissa sunt.
summa. cum salute: ‘to the great advantage of the state)
3² committamus: ⁴ why should we not entru'st ἰ the indic. would be

more natural after exspectamus, and it is noteworthy that H gives
the reading commendamus.
