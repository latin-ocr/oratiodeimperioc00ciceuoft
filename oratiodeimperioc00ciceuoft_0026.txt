xxii DE IMPERIO CN. POMPEI.

the offence which his boldness had given, he went abroad sor two
years, studying again under Molo, and developing his rhetorical
powers.

In Rc. 77 he returned and rapidly came to the front as an
orator. His success in the courts secured his first appointment
in ac. 75, as quaestor in Sicily, where he gained the respect
and affection of the provincials. In Rc. 70 at the requaet os the
Sicilians he undertook the impeachment of Caius Verres, a type
of the corrupt proconsuls to whom allusion is made in the
present speech¹. By this time he was the acknowledged head
of his profession, and soon obtained politica} promotion. ln Rc. 69
he was curule aedile and in Rc. 66 he became praetor. Up to
the time of this appointment he had taken little part in politics,
but he seized the opportunity of supporting the Manilian pro-
posal, partly because he knew its popularity and wished to show
his gratitude to the people who had elected him, partly because
he wished to ingratiate himself with Pompey who at that time
seemed likely to be all-powerful in the State¹. Moreover the
occasion gave him an opportunity οἱ triumphing over his old
rival in the law-courts, Q. Hortensius, who with Catulus opposed
the measure.

Too much stress however need not· be laid on these motives.

ι Cicero was a great man os letters, but no statesman, and we can
hardly blame him sor not seeing that the old Republican system
was doomed, and that by supporting Manilius he was hastening
its downfall and playing into the hands of Caesar. He was
none the less a sincere patriot, and is he advocated a revo-

. lutionary measure, he did it mainly because up to the last he

was short-sighted in political matters, and not because he loved
popularity more than he loved his country.

⁸ In spite os his disclaimcr in 70, l. 4 neque quo Cn. Pompei gratiane
milti per lumc causam conciliari putem, the truth comes out in Q. Cic.
de pet. consulatus 5 5 si quid locuti populariter videamur. id nos α
camilia ficis-se. ut nobis Cn. Pompeium adiungeremus, ue eum, qui
plurimum posset, aas amicum in nostra pelitimu hammus aut cene
non adversarium.
