1⁷] NOTES. 39

N otice that in the enumeration which follows in l. 1 1 Cic. inverts
the order os the three industries, by chiasmus.
ιι ex portu: the portoria, or duties pa'rd on imports and experts,
were farmed out like other vectzgalm to the publicani.
ex decumis: the provinces paid either a fixed land-tax (vecttgral
certum quod stipendian'um dicitur), or variable duties which were let
out at Rome to speculators by the censors. These duties or de umae
in Asia dated from the lex Sempronia of C. Gracchus B.c.123. The
collectors were called decumani.
ια scriptura: the oldest form of revenue from the ager publicus.
As Rome extended her conquests‚ the land of the provinces carne
under this head. The pasture-lands so let were known as pascua,
saltus or silva, those who rented the land (pecuaris) paid a duty to
the publicani according to the number of the cattle grazed, which
was registered (scriptum) on a list, and hence the name.
¹3 terrore bem ε ‘ scare of war!
16 15 exercent atque exig-unt: ‘ farm and collect them‚’ the first word
applies to the publicani, the second to their subordinates.
16 proptu: cf. 13, l. 11.
17 excursio ε ‘ raid ’ or ‘ inroad.' Our idiom would suggest incursio,
but the Romans often invert our point of view, e.g. in the phrase
e regione, opposite to. -
18 familias: the word is used in its proper sense sor the slaves of a
household or establishment. The publicani would employ a host of
minor officials who, just as in the great Roman households‚ would

naturally belong to the class of slaves.

19 sufibus: acc. to Festus saltus est ubi silvae et pastiones sunt.
There is no need to adopt the reading salinis, especially as the three-
sold division corresponds to scriptura, decumae, portorium.

το custodum this refers to officials whose duty it would be to guard

against smuggliug.
magno periculo: cs. the common phrase meo periculo, ‘ at my
own risk.’

υ ωωιῢαῦο...ἰοι·ω1ὥιιθ : both ablatives must be taken with
liberatos. ·
17 ²4 ne...qu1dem: ‘nor again'=01¹›64. It does not necessarily mean
‘ not even.'
mud τ see note on 3, l. 4.
²5 oseem merum ε ‘ was on the point of speaking?
²6 quod ε refers to bellum, not to genere, cf. 6, 1. 3²·
