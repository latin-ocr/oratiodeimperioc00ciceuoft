ANALYSIS OF THE SPEECH.

Cicero, whose energies have hitherto found scope in his practice at
the bar, encouraged by his appointment to the praetorship, seels justified
in making his first appearance on the political platform.

He congratulates himself on his theme, Pompei virtus.

A brief introductory sketch os the situation in the East. Mithridates
and Tigranes are threatening Asia; the Knigffls, whose interests are at
stake, have appealed to Cicero.

Lucullus has retreated; Glabrio is unequal to the tas-lq Pompey is
unanimously called for.

Cicero <lividos his subject into three heads:

‹i› deeeffi genere,
(ii) ᾳςρξμῖἶῖῖμῖῖωᾱῑηι,

(ἰίὶ), de imperatore delt‘genb'o.

(i) de belli genere: the glory of Rome is at make, her revenues are
imperilled. The stain os the great massacre must be removed, for
Mithridates is still unpunished.

What Sulla and Murena did. Ι

What Mithridates has since done, against the Bosporani, and in
negotiating with Sertorius.

Brief allusion to

Pompey's services in Spain,
Lucullus’ services in the East.

The praise of Lucullus is deferred.

Appeals to Roman pride and past traditions: for instance, the
punishment of Corinth sor a mere slight to a legatio.

The salus sociorum is at stake; Ariobarzanes is again dethroned3
socii et amici throughout the East look to Rome and sigh sor Pompey.

Roesons why Pompey is so to be desired.

A second appeal to Roman traditions: wars undertaken in the past
in desence os allies.

Moreover dc maximis vectigalibus agitur: a description of the

wealth of Asifflfffflture, etc. caused by a

mere alam of war.
