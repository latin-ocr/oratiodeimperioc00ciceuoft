48 DE IMPERIO CN. POMPEI. [²⁷.—

¹7 tanus robus: ‘his appointment to a command of such im·
portance.'

esse videatur: see note on ιι, l. ης videatur is difficult to
translate, unless we take it parentheticaliy ‘as it seems! Esse
videatur was a favourite ending with Cicero, and its insertion here
is best explained by Halm’s comment on proficiendum putaretis in
l. 21, as due to a desire to round off his sentence.

18 innocentium: ‘disinterested‚' ‘upright.’

19 ‹tenueram› metuat ‘that it might be difficult for you to
decide.’

22 eorum...qu1 mmo sunt: ‘ the men osto-day: ‘our contemporaries’
(aequales); for the periphrasis cf. 5, 1. ²4· and 14, 1. ι.

²3 antiqustans memor-tam: a vague phrase sor glon’om eorum qm·
apud antiquos memoratum& abstract for concrete, ‘the recorda of the
past,' for ‘the great men recorded in the past.’

virtuto: ‘merit,’ ‘general excellence,' the natural gifts that form
the endowment of a great general. virtus means (ι) the quality or
qualities that make a man (vir), i.e.’manlinoes, under which head
may be included strength, vigonr, cour-age,capacity.worth‚ excellence.
virtue. It is used especially of military talents, in the sense of
courage, gallantry, fortitude. For example in 29, 1. 16 labor,sorti-
tudo, industria, celeritas are given as vrb-tutes imperator-aize, elements
of the general virtus attributed to Pompey in 1. ¹3· In 33. 1. 4
Pompey displays incredibilis ac divina virtus in clearing the sea
os pirates. In 47, 1. 31 the virm of Maximus and Marcellus, is
contrasted with fortuna, merit opposed to luck.

(a) virtue in the sense of moral perfection, e.g. in 36,1. 2 bellandi
virtus is supplemented by the moral and intellectual qualities; cf.
64, l. 3²· In 61, 1. 26 virm: is coupled with innocentia and gravitas.
It is unfortunate that our English derivative, virtue, which the
Elizabethans employed with the freedom of classical usage, has been
confined to the ‘moral’ sense alone.

28 ²5 summo imperator-02 ‘the ideal general)

26 rea: ‘qualities,' ‘qualifications' It is worth while to notice
some of the chief uses of nes in this Speech. Property, fortuma,
interests: 4, 1. 17 magnae res aguntur. 5, 1. ao rernm manen.
17, l. 30 res et fortunae, and 19, 1. ¹4 m magnas, sums of money;
