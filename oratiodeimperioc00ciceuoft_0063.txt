e] NOTES. 31

close tie that connects me with that order. Cicero came os a familia
, equestris. For the use of pro cf. 17, l. 27 pro vestra sapientia, and
52, l. ¹5·

l 5 21 nuno vestra: Bithynia was bequeathed to Rome in B.c. 75. See
Introd. 8. From this point Cicero gives in Oratio Obliqua the
statement of their case which the equites had laid before him.

23 vectigalibus as in 4, l. 13, or according to Halm of the countn'es
that pay tribute.

24 magnis rebus gestis: ‘aster’ or ‘in spite os his great achieve-
ments.’

huic qui successerit: ‘his successor (Glabrio) is wholly unpre-
pared sor....' Huic is=Lucullo, governed by successerit: supply eum
srom qm· as subject of paratum esse. For Glabrio see Introd. ια,
and 19· successerit the subjunctive is due to the Oratio Obliqua3 but
note in l. 21 quae nunc vestra provincia est, an explanatory remark
os the speaker, which formed no part of the statement which he is
quoting. In such subordinate clauses the indicative is retained.

27 deposci atque expeti: the emphasis of two synonymous verbs
thus used for rhetorical effect is often best given in English by a verb
and adverb; ‘is urgently demanded! Cf. 57, 1. 1 expetenti ac
postulanti. .

6 3ο ds genere: ‘the character os the war,' i.e. its urgeney : see πο,
l. 28, and 27, l. 15.

32 quod: grammatically refers to genus, logically to belli, as must
also in quo in l. 1.

33 quod debeat: sor the mood cf. 2, l. 11.

persequendi 2 sc. belli, ‘to its zealous prosecution.’ Persequi
here means to prosecute, continue, in 11, l. 28 it is used in the sense

of to punish or avenge, so in Pro Murena, 21, 44 acceptam iniuriam
persequi non placet Ρ

 

PAGE 3.

2 numm-tum lit. while...so also, i.e. ‘not only...-but also.’

4 multa: notice the position of the word, and how for clearness
Cicero marks it off from magna et gravia, and cf. note on 64, L 1.

5 certissima: ‘the most assured sources of revenue’: for another
use of certus see 12, 1. 7. This usage must also be carefully distin-
guished from certum vectaegral, ‘a fixed tribute,’ e.g. Verr. 3, 6, 12

ceteris impositum vecitgal est certum quod sezpendiarmm dicitur, see
note on 15, l. ιι.
