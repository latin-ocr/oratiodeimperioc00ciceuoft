xxiv DE JMPERJO CN. POMPEI.

The tax-payer and the tax-samer are both to be considered. as
also are the Roman investem, the Knights especially, firmamentum
ordinum. A financial crisis in Asia will involve a collapse of the public

'credit in Rome.

(ii) de belli magnitudine: the war is not only genere necessarium,
there is a danger of underrating its sormidable character.

The eulogy of Lucullus-what he achieved.

But the question may be asked, How can what remains of the war
