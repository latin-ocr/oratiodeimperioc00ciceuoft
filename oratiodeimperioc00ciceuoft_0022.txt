xviii DE IMPERIO CN. POMPEI.

the Marian party in Sicily and Africa, and allowed him on his
return to receive a triumph ¹.

¹4· ln B.C. 78 Sulla died. Pompey was twenty-eight at the
time and therefore too young for the higher offices. Never-
theless in the Revolution of Lepidus the Senate, owing to the
dearth of able men, was obliged to give him a command. He
routed the rebels in the north at Mutina, and then insisted on
being appointed to the command in Spain where the Serton'an
war was still raging. The Senate had little choice in the matter,
and in B.C. 77 receiving the powers of a proconsul he crossed the
Alps into Gau12. After fighting against Sertorius with varying
success, being saved on one occasion at least from a severe
defeat by his older colleague Metellus, he had the good fortune,
owing to the assassination of Sertorius to bring the war to
an end in B.C. 72.

During his absence the Servile or Gladiatorial war had
broken out, and Crassus had just succeeded in quelling the
rising, when Pompey returned from Spain. He arrived in
time to disperse the remnants of the insurgent army and with
characteristic vanity claimed the honours of the bellum scrvae'le³.

15. This was in B.C. 71, and in the same year he and Crassus
while still at the head of their armies, agreed to make common
cause with the democratic faction against the Government.
Their demands could not be refused, and Pompey and Crassus
as consuls⁴ for B.C. 70 at once undid the work of Sulla. The
Tribunate‚ shorn of its prestige and influence by the Dictator,
was restored. The Equites regained a portion of their former
influence in the judicia, and their control os the taxes of Asia.
