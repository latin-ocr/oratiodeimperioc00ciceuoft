58 DE IMPERIO CN. POMPEI. [38-

had been treated as he thought with lack of deferenee by the
Praenestines, when he had visited the town in a semi-official capacity.
On his election as consul litteras I'raencm min‘t, ut sibi magistratus
obviam exiret, locum publice pararet, ubi devenmtur, iamet-taque,
cum exiret inde, praesto essent. Up tiu that time the state had
made special provision to obviate such demnds (ne quid tale
imperarent sociis), but the example of Postumius and the compliance
of the Praenestines led to increased arrogance and the most oppreesive
requisitions. For graphic descriptione of these itinera see Phil. 2,
²3· 57 of Antony‚ and Verr. 5, ιο, 27 of Verres.

υ civium nummorum: the Italians had become Roman citizens at
the close of the Social War, by the Lex Plautia Papiria 89 mc.

24 fieri existimetis: we might expect fiat alone. but see note on
putetis 11, 1. ¹7·

26 hibernie: sc. militum vestrorum, the antithesis to armis: an
immunity from maintaining an army in winter-quartem was the
privilege of the favoured provincial towns known as abitum liberae„
and from a letter of Cicero ad Att. 5, 21. 7 we gather that wealthy
states paid large sums to be relieved of the burden (ne in hiberna
milites afferent, magnas pecunias dabant).

29 ln se aevom: ‘strict,’ for the constr. cf. pro clu. το, 56 iudices
severi in eos solos. The greed and extortion of Roman governors in
the provinces led to the establishment of the first quaestio perpetua
or standing court for the trial of such offences (de pecuniis repe*
tundis). As however the iudices were drawn from the governing
class, and bribery was rampant, it was difficult to convict offenders.
Caius Gracchus transferred the iuda-ia to the equi‘tes, Sulla restored
them to the senate, Pompey and Crassus by a compromise divided
the privilege between the two orders and the trabunt· amr-1¹13 but
bribery was still prevalent and successful (see 37, 1. r 5).

39 3ο exconm: see note on 14, 1. π.

3¹ non modos for non modo nom there is no real ambignity in
this idion), as the negative is contained in the 5⁶4..un that
follows, ‘not to speak of ....... there is not even ....... cf. the
parallel construction of οὐχ ὅπως ...... οὐδέ.
mnus: ⁸ act of violence,’ they abstained from plundering.
3² vestigium: ‘the track of their passagess they had not ravaged
the country.
muto: used as an adj. Cf. 67, 1. η civitatempoecaeam, ‘peace-
nble.' or here ‘non-mmmm)
