trouble in his rear. Mithridates and Tigranes had fallen on his
weakened reserves, and though he relieved the troops at T igrano-
certa he was too late to save the army in Pontus. Triarius his
lieutenant was forced to a battle at Ziela, and his defeat was
so complete that Lucullus learned the news not from his own
soldiers but through the reports of the nativesl. Disasters fell
thick and fast: he found that during his absence in Armenia his
enemies had procured his recall, and his successor Glabrio had
already landed in Asia. There was nothing for it but retreat,
and it is one of the proudest of Lucullus' achievements that in
the face of such difficulties he brought his army safely back
from Armenia to Asia. But the result of eight years’ fighting
had been lost. Glabrio declined to take over the command.
The Fimbrian legions had to be disbanded. Mithridates not
only re·0ccupied his kingdom, but raided Cappadocia and ad-
vanced into Bithynia².

Ariobarzanes, once more dethroned, sought help in vain
stom Lucullus and from Glabrio.

We must turn now to the war with the Pirates‚ and to the
career of the man who was to supersede both Lucullus and
Glabrio and bring the long struggle to an end.

Cn. Pompeius Alagnus.

13. Pompeius, whose virtus singulari.»- et prope divina is
the main theme of Cicero's speech, was born in B.C. 106.

He served as a lad of seventeen under his father Cn. Pompeius
Strabo during the Marsian War³‚ and on Sulla's return to Italy
joined his standard with an army which he levied on his own
authority⁴. Sulla employed him, in spite of his youth⁵‚ to crush
