duabus mammis: Hither and F urther, citerior et ulterior. The
division was made at the end of the Second Punic War. ·

18 cama msalpina: the coast of the provincia Narbonensis, or
Southern Gaul. Provincia still survives in the name Provence.

confirmata. : ⁴ secured,' belongs to Hispaniis as well as to Gallia
the nearer subject, with which it is constructed, possibly to avoid
confusion with praesidiis ac navibus.

For the fact see Mommsen 1v. p. 1 13, ‘his (Pompey’s) lieutenants
meanwhile addressed themselves to the clearing of the Spanish and
Gallie coasts!

19 Achaiam ι the Roman province, which included the Peloponnese
and the central part of Greece proper, or in other words the modern
kingdom of Greece without Thessaly z the name however was at this
time osten loosely used sor the Peloponnese alone, and hence Cicero
adds omnem Graeciam to define a wider area, cf. in Pis. 16, 37 lege ea
omnis ciat tibi Achaia, Thessalia, Athenae, cuncta Graecia addicta.

20 duo maria: the Adriatic (mare superum) and the Tuscan or
Tyrrhenian Sea (mare inferum).

ἰι adornavit: ‘equipped‚' ‘ provided.’ Cf. 20, l. 2, and 21, l. 14.

ut.. ‚profectus est ε ‘ within 49 days of setting out.' ut often means
when, but it does not often stand for ex quo tempore as here. Roby
(¹7¹9) gives an instance from Plautus, Stich. 29 nam viri nostri domo
ut abierunt, hic tertiust annus. Cf. the use of ἐπεὶ and ἐπειδὴ,
Aesch. Ag. 40 δέκατον μὲν ἔτος τόδ’ ἐπεὶ Πριάμου....ἦρα.ν.

²3 officia: the great stronghold of the pirates, Cilicia Aspera or
Trachea‚ the rugged Cilicia, to be distinguished from the first Roman
province of Cilicia (established in B.c. 103) which lay to the
East.

‘15 imperio: ‘military power,’ potestas of civil authority; but the
distinction should not be pressed in translation, ⁴ authority and
power.’

cretensibus: governed by both verbs ademit and imperavz't3 for
their appeal to Pompey see 46, 1. 13. The proconsul Q. Metellus
was at this time engaged in reducing Crete, which had been a nest of
piracy. Pompey’s authority, which by the Gabinian law extended
for fifty miles inland from the coast, gave him, os course, control
over that long and narrow island. The rumours of his mild treat-
ment οἱ the pirates in Cilicia induced the Cretans to send envoys to
him, and he allowed himself to be embroiled in an undignified
quarrel with Metellus, who refused to be superseded.
