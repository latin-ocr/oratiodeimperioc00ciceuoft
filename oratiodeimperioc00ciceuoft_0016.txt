xii DE IMPERIO CN. POMPEI.

Aquillius to a cruel death¹, and occupied the whole province
of Asia. The day of vengeance for the oppressed provincials
came at last, when from Ephesus Mithridates issued his famous
decree that all ltalians, without distinction of age or sex, should
be massacred on one and the same day throughout Asia&

5. Rome was bound to act now. and to act vigorously3 but
how was it to be done? Mithridates was extending his conquests
into Europe ε he had made overtures (too late, it is true) to the
revolting Italians; Macedonia and Greece were in his power.
But the struggle with the Italians was not yet ended, the rivalry
of Marius and Sulla was just beginning. At this juncture Sulla
behaved with decision and patr-iotism. He put out of sight the
interests and the peril of his own party, he lest the smouldering
embers of the dying war, and with a force of only 30,000 men,
without a single vessel of war, set out to reconquer what was lost.

His position was most difficult. He had to depend upon re·
quisitions to supply and pay his troops: the pirates, Mithridates'
allies against the common enemy, held the seas3 and, worst os
all, the Marian revolution soon cut him adrift from Rome. He
was deposed and proscribed, his successor Flaccus had been
appointed and might at any moment appear, to add to his
distractions.

Mithridates’ plan of attempting to crush his adversaries in
the open field proved their deliverance. At Chaeronea and
at Orchomenus Sulla utterly defeated armies of greatly superior
strength led as usual by Greek mercenary commanders.

The vigorous efforts of Lucullus, his legatus, had raised some
semblance os a fleet, and in B.c. 85 Sulla was in a position to

open negotiations with Mithridates whose cruelty and oppression
had already caused a reaction against his rule in Asia. Flaccus
avoiding a conflict had reached Chalcedon the year before,
where he fell a victim to a mutiny os his own troops and the ,
intrigues of Fimbria his successor.
