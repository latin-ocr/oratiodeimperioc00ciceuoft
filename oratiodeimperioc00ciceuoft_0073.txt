19] NOTES. 41

cononatus habent: ‘have vast sums invested.’ Cf. 4, l. 18 res
occupatae.

5 [eorum]: not wanted, probably a gloss from partim comm, or
due to the doubling of the final syllables of numerum.

6 pronibere ε aliquem aliqua re or ab aliqua re. Cf. 19, 1. 17, and
⁵3, 1· 27-

7 a ro publica: for a calamitate reipublicae, a very common con-
densation of phrase, cf. 19, l. 26.

8 parvi refert: ‘it matters little that while 'neglecting the publicani
now we shall subsequently, through victory, regain our revenues.’
So the passage may be translated, but it is not without difficulty.
Endless attempts at emendation have been made. Recuperare is
explained by Eberhard as present sor future, of what is expected with
certainty. Many edd. prefer to read posse forpostea. But publicanis
omissis or amissis is the stumbling-block to most. Halm (ed. revised
by Laubrnann) reads posse publicanos amissa vectigalia nostra victoria
recuperare3 Richter and Eberhard, rem publicam ipsam illa vecti-
galia postea victoria recuperare. None of the conjectures is con-
vincing, and Ι have therefore retained the text of Miiller.

9 redimendi: redimere is the technical expression sor undertaking
by contract, and is thus used of the publicani. Cicero means that
the same contractors will no longer have the means to bid, while
others will not care to do so from sear of similar ruin. For redi-
mere )( locare cf. Horace Odes 3, x, 34 huc frequens caementa
demittit redemptor, and Odes 2, 18, 17 tu secanda marmora locas sub
ipsum sun us.

19 ιι quod: the relative clause first, as often in Latin; the beginner
should remember both in composition and in translation how much
more common this is than in English. 1t is generally best to take
the antecedent clause first.

14 tum, oum,..a.miserant: the point of time emphasized, and hence
the indic. The plupft. indic. generally in Cicero implies indefinite
frequency, ‘whenever,' so Verr. 5, ro cum rosam viderat, tum
incipere ver arbitrabatur. It is noteworthy that the Harleian reads
amiserunt. ,

15 solutione...conoidisse: ‘ payment was suspended, and there was
a collapse of the public credit.'

16 rem ε ‘property‚' ⁴ means.‘ Cf. res magnas above.

ut non : lit. so as not to, that is ⁴ without involving many more in
their own ruin': in sentences restrictive of a preceding statement
