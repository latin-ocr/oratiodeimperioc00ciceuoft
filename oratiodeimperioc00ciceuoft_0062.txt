30 DE IMPERIO CN. POMPEI. [8-

vtrtute: here: ‘merit.' See note on 27, 1. 23·

ιο modus: limit, ‘ 1 shall have to aim at compressiora rather than at
fluency.'

4 ια dudm: ⁶ originates: :initium ducit. Cf. Brut. 5, ἰι hinc tum
ductus est sermo.
grave z ‘serious,’ cf. 23, l. 11 gravis atque vehemens opinio.

13 vectiganum: from nom. vectigales, ‘ tributaries‚’ ‘ payers of
tribute? as also in 7, 1. 19. Cf. Livy αι, 41, α vectigalis snspen-
‹liariusque et servus populi Romani. The datives are best taken
with bellum infertur.

¹4 anthi-mate et 'rim-m: see Introduction, 2. 3, and ¹9·

,, relictus: ‘lest unpunished.’

¹5 uiam: the Roman province, see Introd. r.

16 qutibus Rom. hone-tissima viris: ‘ my worthy friends, the
Roman knights.' The beginner should note this idiom, which mn
osten be rendered into English without an apposition. Thus in
10, 1. 9 Lucullo summo viro means ‘ the great ' or ⁴ the distinguished
L.’ The idiom is partly due to the lack of a definite article in Latin,
but it also illustrates the logical clearness and love os distinctnoes
which characterized the Romans. The same tendency is shown in
their dislike of attaching two epithets, without the copula, to the
same noun. Roman precision requires bella multa et magna where
we are content with the less accurate phrase, ‘many great wars.'

Equites: the Equites were originally the mvalry os the state, but
by the time os Marius they had oeased to serve as horse-soldier! in
the army, their place being taken by foreign auxiliaries. This
change was hasteued by the Lex Sempronia, n.c. ¹23· This law
called into existence the Ordo Equester, that is, the class of citizens
who possessed an equestrian fortune. This new and rapidly
inereasing moneyed class soon became a force in politioe. As the
financiers of Rome they found a rich field for speculatiou in fai-ming
the taxes of the Provinces. The tax-sarmers were the publicani, the
publicans os the New Testament, and Cicero often uses the term as
identieal with equites: see 16, l. 18; and ¹7* l. 28.

¹7 aguntur: ⁸ are at stake‚' cf. 6, l. 1. ,

anagnu res occupans: ⁸ vast sums invested in the fai-ming ot
your taxes' ι res, plural because the property of several individuals is
implied, so also pecuniae in ¹8, 1. 4. vectigalibus here from nom.
vatrggalia.
