see note on 47, 1. 5.

57 32 obtrectatum: used impersonally: for obtrectare of carping oppo-
sition see 21, 1. 20 qui huic obtrectant legi. ‘Wheresore the carping
opposition seems to me the more unworthy)

33 anne· pleonastic for an, and much less usual.

id quod: or quae res is used (instead of quod alone) to refer to a
group os words or an idea, cf. Caesar B.G. 4, 1 mullum sunt in
venattbnibus...quae res vires alit. (Allen and Goeenough, Latin
Grammar, 200 e.)

1 ne legaretur: the legati were chosen by the Senate, but the
general in command naturally had a say in the matter. The Lex
Gabinia gave to Pompey the right of selecting his officials sor the
campaign, but Gabinius as tribune could not leave the city till his
year of office was over. Moreover there was a natural feeling against
a man’s deriving personal promotion even indireetly from a measure
which he had himself proposed. The Lex Licinia and the second
Lex Aebutia laid down that when anyone brought sorward a proposal
affecting potestas or curatio, neither he nor his colleagues nor his
relations were eligible even sor subordinate posts in connexion with
such office or power.

expetenti ac postulanti: ‘at Pompey's special request.’ See
note on 5, l. ἠ deposci atque expeti.

ἰ quem velit: the legatus of his choice; the mood is due to the
implied feeling that it was because he wished it that the authorities
refused to make the concession t contrast quos voluerunt in l. 4.

5 digmtas: ‘ prestige.'

6> consumta: more emphatic than restituta, as corresponding to
constitutus in l. 8.

8 periculo: cf. 16, l. 203 the lator legis was responsible for the
results of his law. The failure of Pompey would have meant tuin,
perhaps death to Gabinius. As it was he was roughly handled

by the Senators‚ who in the words of Dio ὀλίγου καὶ ἀπέκτειναν τὸν
Γαουὶνιον ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ συνεδρίῳ.
58 an: introduces a clause co-ordinate to in uno Gabinio sunt, etc„
