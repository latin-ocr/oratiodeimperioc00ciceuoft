4¹7] NOTES. 63

‘from the diet os the people of Crete’3 commum-:rb κοινόν occurs
frequently in the Verrines.

14 noster imperator: ‘one of our generals.’ Cf. 26, l. 13.

16 ereremum civitates: see note on 35, 1. 25.

18 legatum ε this is obscure. We know that Mithridates sent
envoys to Sertorius (9, 11. 1 ancl 2), but no mention is made else-
where of this mission to Pompey. A slight is intended to Metellus
Pius (see Introd. 14), who was senior to Pompey, and who saved him
from defeat in the Spanish campaign. Possibly, as Drumann sug-
gests, Pompey caught a spy of the king fh his camp, and was led by
his vanity to believe that Mithridates was making overturoe to him.

eum: this word and Pompeius legatum semper iudicavit are
bracketed by Eberhard as a gloss z they seem to contradict legatum
in the preceding sentence, unless they are intended to correct it, ‘an
envoy, at least Pompey always thought so.'

19 quibus erat molestum: ‘those who were annoyed at his being
sent to P. rather than to thern) as the infinitive clause (eum) missum
esse is the subject of erat molestum, so the clause speculatorem...iudi-
cari is the object of maluerunt. Cf. Horace, Sat. 1, 8, 3 (me) maluit
esse deum, ⁸ preferred that I should be a god.'

23 iudiciis: see note on 2, 1. 13.

25 existimetis: see note on 11, l. 17.

47 26 renatae: see note on 28, l. 27.
praestare: ‘ answer for‚’ ‘guarantee in his own case.' Cf. 55, l. 1 5
salvos praestare, ‘ to answer for the safety of.’

28 sicut aequum ost: supply dicere from dicam-us.

de potestate deorum: ‘of that which lies in the hands of the
gods-² Cicero implies that while it would be impious to call oneself
felix, a man may with due reverence speak of the felicitas οἱ another.

29 timide ot pauca: ‘with reverence and brevity.’ For the combi-
nation of adverb and adj. cf. Orator 21, 70 de quo praeclare et multa
praecipiuntur.

ummo: Q. Fabius, five times consul (Rc. 233—209): by his
defensive tactics against Hannibal he saved Rome from defeat at a
critical time, and earned the nickname of Cunctator. Cf. Virgil,
Aen. 6, 846 unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem.

30 Marcello: M. Claudius Marcellus, also five times consul (B.c.
222-208) and the conqueror of Syracuse. He was the most brilliant

‹Xfthe generals opposed to Hannibal, with the exception os Scipio
ricanus.
