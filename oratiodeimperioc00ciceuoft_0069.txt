14] NOTES. 37

8 audent: their respect sor Rome checks them.
9 nine summo periculo: they sear the reprisals of other generals,

Glabrio, sor instance, who was on the spot.

, 13 10 in quo summa. sint omma: ‘in whom all the highest qualifica-

tions are found.'
1 1 propter esse: propter is used adverbially here, ‘is nigh at hand.’

Cf. 16, l. 16 propter adsint, and coram in 66, l. 14„
carent aegrius: ‘wherefore they feel the lack of him the more

bitterly.’
taciti rogant: ‘they mutely ask,' the adjective is much more

usual than the adverb in this idiom; cf. 48, 1. 13 tacitus optare.

Ι have adopted the reading of the Harleian in preference to the old

reading tacite.

16 dig-nos quorum: translate quorum as=ut eorum, and for the
idiom of dzgnus qui with final subjunctive cf. Tuscul. 1, 1 degna in
quibus elaborarent, ‘ things worth spending toil on.’

17 hoc magis: hoc is abl„ ‘all the more.’

18 oum unpeno: the praetors of this time were all invested with
proconsulare imperium.

19 adventus: plural, but translate by singular to balance expugna-
tione. For these plural usages cf. rationes, dzkcfflinae, and see note
on 1, l. 5.

21 praesentem: ‘on the spot,' ‘in their midst! The ablatives
tanta temperantia, mansuetudine etc. must be rendered ‘of such)
or ‘endowed with such moderatim, clemency, etc.’ Temperantia
moderatiori, sels-control, 36, 1. 5 and 40, ll. 5--142 mansuetudo
gendeness, clemency, 42, 1. 2 where it is a manifestation of huma-
nitas in the sense of kindness, humanity, see 36, 1. 6 and 42, l. 33.

23 commoretur: H reads commoretur, and the subj. would certainly
be more usual in a general statement like this. Cicero means ‘happy
are those, whoever they may be, among whom his stay is most pro-
longed.’ The indicative would point to a particular instance.
