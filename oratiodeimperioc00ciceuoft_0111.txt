71] NOTES. ⁷9

6 amplitudine: ‘ elevation.’
pem-tcum: sc. repellendis, dat. of purpose, so honoribus adipis-
ceradis. Cf. remedia morbis et vulneribus.
8 ut: ‘in so far as.’ For praestare cf. 55, l. 15.
9 honorem: in general sense ‘post of honour,' but Cicero doubtless
is thinking of the consulship.
ex hoc 1000: as a political orator.
ιο eadem...ra.tione: Cicero returns to the point of view from which
he started, see 1, 11. 5-17, he means still to earn political pro-
motion by his energy as an advocate.
1 1 feret: ‘if such is your good pleasure,‘ for other intransitive usages
offero cf. ut sert opinio, si occasio tulerit, sic fata ferebant.

71 12 mnu: the dative is often found with susceptum and other perfect
participles, especially when they are used in an adjective sense. Cf.
milti res tota provisa est, Verr. 4, 42, 91 and mihi deliberatum et con-
stitutum est, Leg- Ag. ι, 8, 2 5. It is hardly a dative of the agent,
sor instance the last quotation means ‘it is for me a thing deliberated
on and determined.'

13 ut...ut: note the repetition of utwhieh is not common in classical
writers, ‘so far from seeming...1 am aware.'

16 non inutiles: :utilissimas‚ a good instance os litotes or meiosis.

20 maenibus: ‘ interests,’ see note on 1, 1. 5.
