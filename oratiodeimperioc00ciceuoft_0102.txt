but really contrasted with it. In English we should make the first
clause subordinate, introducing it by ‘ while)

io quos...honoria eausa nomino: ‘whom 1 mention with all
respect‘; srom this formula (cs. the ‘ honourable member' os Parlia-

mentary usage) we gather that they were living contemporaries of
Cicero. Nothing else is known os them.

ιι in uno Gabinio: ‘in the case of Gabinius alone'; sor the idiom
cf. virgil, Aen. α, 541 talis in hoste ficit Prtiamo.

ια diligent-ea: ⁸ serupulous‚‘ pedantically accurate.

¹3 in hoc imperatore: goes very awkwardly with esse deberet:
Halm explains it as a rhetorical assimilaston, in being loosely used
sor cum. Eberhard brackets srom in to constituit as a gloss. The
idea has been already expressed in 57, l. 7.

¹4 praecipuo iure ι :praeter alios, or potissimum, ‘though he should
have a special right to be legatus.'

16 gravabuntur : ‘ do it grudgingly.’

ego me profiteor relaturum z Cicero as praetor had the right to
bring a motion before the Senate (refirre ad sertatum). But his
motion was liable to be vetoed by any magistrate who held the same
or a higher office. A consul might further by an eddam, in the
form ne quis de ea re ad senatum reserat, declare the proposal out of
order. As Halm points out, Cicero is making rather a needloes
display of courage. 1f the Manilian measure passed, Pompey’s
command against the pirates lapsed, and with it the objections to
Gabinius (see 57, 1. ι) seu to the ground.

17 inimicum edietum: H gives cuiusquam im'quilas.

18 vom-um: ‘proceeding from you,‘ ‘bestowed by you‚‘ referring
to the privilege (ius benfia'umque) granted to Pompey by the Lex
Gabinia of nominating his own legati for the war against the
pirates.

19 intercessionem z the right of intersering (ius intercessionis), and
at once putting a stop to any measure which they deemed injurious
to their order, was the special privilege os the Tribunes of the Plebs.
In the Senate, however, a veto might be exercised by any of the
higher magistrates under the conditions stated in note on l. 1⁶3 such
interserence was termed intercessio collegae. Cicero is referring
here specially to the veto os the tribunes, thus indirectly flattering the
people whose magistrate the tribune was.

ιο minantur: sc. to veto or induce someone to veto.

quid licent: ‘ what is permitted to them,’ i.e. ⁸ how iar they may
