¹3 auo loeo: 20, 1. 3²·

, 14 ut...v1deatur: ⁸ so as to make it clear that my words neither rob
him os his true same, nor ascribe to him a same that is false!

11 16 exorsus: occurs only here in Cicero, it is not equivalent to
exordinata ‘since that is the point with which my speech began.'

¹7 videte: ‘see to it’ (syn. reputo, considero). Cf. Lael. 3, 10 viderint
sapientes, ‘let the philosophers see to it.’

puteus: the subjunctive is dependent on videte but appears to
add nothing to the sense. It is as if we should say, ‘bethink you
what frame of mind you think you must adopt.’ This form ,of
expression, which is common in Cicero, is however held by Halm to
be not merely pleonastic5 he compares it to the Greek use of the
optative with ἄν, and illustrates his meaning from 26, l. 10 coniectura
pempioe'te, quantum illud bellum factum sit, ‘how great that war has
grown‚' whereas the sactum' putetis os the text implies ‘how great
(in your opinion) it may have grown.' For other instancoe see
videatur in 27, l. 17, and putaretis l. 21, also em'stimetis 46, l. 25.

18 madores nostri: Cicero is referring to the campaigns against the
Illyrian pirates in ²29 B.c.‚ by conquen’ng whom the Romans earned
the gratitude of the Greek states that had suffered from their
depredations.

19 iniuriosius: the comparative has a depreciatory force as often3
‘somewhat unsairly‚’ or ‘in a rather high-handed fashion.’ Cf. 1. 22
appellati superbius, ‘ addressed somewhat arrogantly.’

ἰο nuntio: ‘a message,' used in this sense in both sing. and pl.
Cf. acerbum nuntium alicui perferre Cic. Balb. 28, 64, and nuntii
tn'stcs Att. 3, 17, 1, our ‘bad news.' For the circumstances see
Introd. 4.

ἰι quo tandem ammo: ‘what‚ 1 ask, ought to be your feelings?'
tandem emphasises the question like the Greek δή. Cf. Cat. 1, 1
Quousque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra? With animo
esse cf. 12,1. 1 quo animo ferre? the daecfiptive ablative or abl. of
quality.

iegati: Cicero purposely understates the case in order to bring

out the contrast between the Romans ,οἱ his day and their forefathers.

As a matter of fact the Roman envoys were grossly insulted by the

mob and the loeders of the Achaean league, Diaeus aud Critolaus,

who forced on the war which ended in the destruction os Corinth
ιο. 146.
