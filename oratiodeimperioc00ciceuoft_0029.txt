in respect of his continentia: he keeps his troops well in hand, his
hiberna are not oppressive.

His temperantia accounts for his celeritas, he resists all the attrac-
tions and temptations that hinder others. The natives of Asia look
upon him as de caelo delapsum, their saith in the old Roman virtues
revives.

His facilitas, his willingness to hear complaints and grant easy access
to all, his fides in which even his enemies trust implicitly.

(c) auctoritas: a general’s auctoritas is largely dependent on public
belief in him. Cicero recalls the famous day os Pompey's election to
the command against the Pirates, the vilitas annonae which at once
followed.

Pompey's arrival in the East has saved Asia, and the appeal of the
distant Cretans testifies still further to his prestige.

(d) felicitas: Cicero maintains that in the case of Rome's greatest
generals fortuna as well as virtus has been a factor in their success.

Pompey’s filicitas is unparalleled. Then follows a brief surn-
mary of the argument, and a statement os the follo'wing conclusion.
Pompey, even if a private citizen in Rome, would be the inevitable
choice for the command ; but he is in the East, on the spot, with an
army: surely the gods themselves ordained such opportunitas. ’

The arguments of the oppositi0n‚ Catulus and Hortensius.

Hortensius’ argument is ‘ad unum onmia deferri non operiere? But
he said this on the occasion of the Gabinian Law, and surely the result
has justified the anomaly.

Without further answer to this argument, Cicero enlarges on the
Pirates and Pompey's victory. ’

He incidentally touches on the appointment of Gabinius as Pompey's
legatus.

Catulus' argument ‘si quid Pompeio sactum esset' is turned by a
complimmt, sailing Pompey the country will look to Catulus.

His most weighty argument is ‘ne quid novi fiat contra exempla
atque instituta maiorum.’

In reply to this Cicero appeals to violations of precedent in the
cases of Scipio and Marius, and notably Pompey himself. He adds
that many of the special commands held by Pompey were bestowed
with Catulus'-approval.

A long list of instances in which Pompey has been allowed to violate

preczdenn and especially his being granted a triumph when only a Roman
