vi PREFACE,

always one or two boys in a form who can be induced
to take an interest in textual criticism‚ provided that
it is not of too recondite a nature.

It is hoped that the Index, with its lists os case
and prepositional usageS, may be of service in revision
to summarize what has been learned in the reading of
the speech.

The Introduction is based almost entirely on
Mommsen. The text is in the main that of Miiller
(Teubner series), but 1 have consulted throughout
Mr A. C. Clark’s collation of the Harleian MS.
(A necdota Oxoniensa‚ Part νη).

In preparing the notes I have made use of the
editions of Richter and Eberhard, Halm, Professor
. Wilkins, and J. Hunter—Smith.

Mr A. W. W. Dale, Fellow and Tutor of Trinity
Han, has kindly helped me in revising the proofs, and
1 am indebted to him sor many valuable suggestions
