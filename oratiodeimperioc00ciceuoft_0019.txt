fifty sail carrying 10,000 picked troops and the flower of the
Roman exiles had actually set out for Italy. Lucullus, though
hampered by the loss of the ships at Chalcedon, managed to
over-take and destroy this squadron, thus saving his country from
a renewal of civil warl.

10. The brilliant campaigns which followed can be but
briefly summarized here. Lucullus at once invaded Pontus and
· in B.c. 72 destroyed a second army at Cabira, aster which nearly
two years were spent in reducing the towns of Sinope, Heraclea,
and Amisus2. Mithridates who had escaped only through the
greed of the Roman soldiers for the rich booty which he strewed
in his flight3, sought refuge with his son-in-law Tigranes⁴‚ and
he, having with short-sighted policy refused to join in the war,
now detained the fugitive in semi-captivity.

It was clear that if Lucullus’ work was to be done thoroughly‚
Tigranes must be dealt with ; but the Government according to
its wont declined to take the initiative, and Lucullus, like Sulla,
had to act alone. His reorganization of Asia, his attempts to
remedy the grievances of the provincials5, and to check the
extortion of the publicani, had made him unpopular with the
Equites who now began to intrigue for his recall. This lack
of sympathy between general and government made it difficult
for him to ask for reinforcements, and yet fresh troops were
urgently needed. His two best legions were the same that
Flaccus and Fimbria had led in B.C. 863 they had been promised
their well-earned discharge after Cabira and it was dangerous

⁶ Cicero does justice to this side of Lucullus in Acad. Pr. 11. 1, 3
in codem (Lucullo) tanta prudentia fuit in constituendis temperandisque
civitatibus, tanta aequitas, ut hodie stet Asia Luculli institutis servandis
et quasi vestigiis persequendis.
