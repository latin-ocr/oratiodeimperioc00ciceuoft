meeting was twice postponed: ad Ait. 1, 11, 2 nec, quando futura
sint comitia, sciri. The reason for this is not known. According to
Dio Cassius, street-rioting by the partisans of the candidates was the
cause. As Cicero received the votes of all the eenturies (cunctis
suffragiis, de Off. 2, 17, 59), his name was proclaimed first (primus
or primo loco renuntiatus) by the presiding magistrate, as there could
be no doubt about his election. The claims of the other candidates
were being decided by the counting of the votes (diribitio) when the
interruption occurred.

16 qma...1udiearetis‚ etc. : Cicero means that the people by electing
him showed their approval of his course of life (vitae rationes> and
advised future candidates to follow his example.

18 honoribus mandandis: ‘ by conferring high office on me’: honor
is the regular word in Cic. for public office, position of dignity. For
the constr. cf. 67, l. 33 detrimentis accifflendis. Our idiom prefers as
a rule to use two substantives, the one dependent on the other,
e.g. Liv. 6, 14, 11 contentus possidendis agris, where we should say,
‘with the occupation os the fields ’3 cf. ab urbe condita.

19 ad agendum z see 1, l. 2. vigilanti : ‘to a man of active mind.’

2¹0 ex forensi usu: ‘practice at the ban' in the law-conns, which
were in the neighbourhood of the fhrum. Ovid (Tristia 4‚10‚ 18)
says of his brother, who was intended sor the bar, that he was fortia
verbosi natus ad arma fhri.
