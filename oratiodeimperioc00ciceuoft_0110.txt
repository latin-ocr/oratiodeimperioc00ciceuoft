78 DE IMPERIO CN. POMPEI. [88—

18 videto: Halm retains the vulgate reading videte ut and refers to
pro Roscio Am. 46, 135 ctiam valetis ut omnes despiciat, ‘you see how
he looks down on all,’ but the context seems to require ‘whether,'
and Madvig's conjecture horumne gives a satisfactory sense.

Eberhard retains ut, bracketing quare videte as a gloss, and
connects it with the preceding clauses.

¹9 auetoritatibus: abl. ease, ‘to reply to their arguments by the
authority os these names.’

69 21 mam tua-m: with no contemptuous force.

22 legem...sentent1am: ‘your measure, your intention, your speech?

vehemenussime: ‘most heartily.'

2 3 auctore populo: ‘with the approval of the people‚' as shown by
their crowded attendance and enthusiasm, see l. 26 cum tantam
multitudinem etc.

²4 vim aut minas: see note on 57, 1. 8 for the treatment of Ga·
binius at the hands os the aristocrats.

25 animi: ‘spirit.’

27 quantam...v1aemun2 Eberhard brackets these words as a gloss
on tantam, on the ground of the meaningless repetition of videamus,
videmus.

29 re...rwu1tate: ‘the proposal or the possibility ot' carrying it into
effect)

31 benenom: is explained by potestate praetoria, see note on 51, 1. ι.

ΡΛαιι 26.

1 detero: ‘1 place at the disposal οἱ...]

70 2 1000 temploque: ‘consecrated spot,' i.e. the rostra. The word
templum does not necessarily imply a building, it can be applied to
any space marked off by the ritual of the augurs. Such a loc-us
inaug-aratus was necessary for the transaction os business with the
people, and hence the rostra came to be a templum, cf. Livy 8, 14,
ια rostris earum (sc. navium Antiatium) suggestum in foro αττηις-
tum adamare placuit, rostraque id templum appellatum.

praesident: ‘protect'3 Cicero points to the templa which
surrounded the sorum and towered above it from the Capitoline hin.
3 ιιι rem publicam meunt: ‘enter upon public life‚' adeunt sor the
more usual accedunt. For respublica see note on 8. 1. 27.
4 rogatu: cf. iussu, iniussu alicuius.
quo: sometimes used in final clauses without a comparative.
on. Pompei cratim: see Introd. αι.
