and tradem, and the conquests of Alexander the Great had
stamped something of the civilization of Hellas. Mithridates'
first attempts to extend his dominions led him northwards to
the eastern and northern shores of the Black Sea, where the
Greek coast-towns of the Crimea hailed him as a deliverer from
the wild Scythian and Celtic tribes who imperilled their existence.

in answer to their appeals to Rome that Manius Aquillius an

ex· -consul was sent, without an army, to support the governor
of the province. Again Mithridates gave way, but continued
to prepare for a struggle which was now inevitable‚ and when
Aquillius encouraged Nicomedes to harass the borders of
Pontus and forbad Mithridates to defend himself, the storm
broke. With a vast army Mithridates overran Bithynia, crushed

the feeble opposition of the Roman and native troopS‚ put
