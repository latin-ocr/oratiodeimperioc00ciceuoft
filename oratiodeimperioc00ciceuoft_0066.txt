34 DE IMPERIO C N. POMPEI. [0—
retum of Sulla from the East. He endeared himself to the nativa,

educated the sons of the Spanish chiefs, and kept both Metenn- nnd .

Pompey at bay for years. His death alone put an end to the war:
Introd. 14.

3 munatium maximeque divor-1⁸: i.e. in the East and in the
West3 ‘in regions most widely sundered and remote,' or ‘at oppo-
site ends of the earth,' and cf. 31, l. 8 tam late divulsum atque dis-
persum, 46, l. 11 ex locis tam longinquis tamque diversit.

4 uno connino: ‘in concert.'

mnis: bini takes the place of duo with substantivas which are
used in the plural only, or with those which have a different meaning
in the plural as compared with the singular. Cf. bina castra, binae
litterae.

5 Μαρια conventione: ‘you might be distracted by a twofold
attack upon your supremacy' ς Caesar thus uses anceps of an attack
from two sides, or in front and rear, e.g. B. G. ι, 26 anctjtn‘ti proelio.
The derived sense of ‘dangerous‚' ‘hazardous‚' does not occur in
Cicero. For dismtzgo in the sense of ‘ to make a diversion against
an enemy,' cf. Livy 35, 18 Hannibalem mittendum in Africam esse
ad distringendos Romanos.

For de imperto=uter tmperaret cf. de off. 1, 38 sic cum Cenabo-is,
cum Cimbris bellum, ut cum inimicis, gerebatur, uter esset (501 exist·
enee), non uter imperaret (for supremacy).

10 6 sartonam atquo Hispaniensis: the English idiom requires the
subst. instead of the adj. here, ‘the danger that threatened us nom
the West, from Sertorius and Spain,’ so in altera parte, ‘in the East’3
see Introd. ¹4 sor Sertorius.

7 firmamenti ιο roboria: ‘strength and support’; Cicero often
couplae these words in metaphor, cf. pro Mur. 28, 58 firmamentum
ac robur totim accusationis: cs. also 17, 1. 33 firmamentum caetorum
ordinum.

8 divino: not as strong as our ‘divine ’ς translate by ⁸ mmellous,'
or ‘excellent.’ angulanz see note on 3, 1. 8.

9 summo viro: see note on 4, l. 16.

10 initia ma rerum guarum: inavit 'takes the place os nn adj.
which was lacking in Latin: we must translate ‘his achievements nt
the outset‚' cf. 1, l. 7 huius auctoritatem Ioci.

11 teneat-m: ⁸ good fortune ’ 3 see note on felicitas 28, 1. ²7·

meo...aoomernnt: ‘his recent misfortunes at the close! See
Introd. η.
