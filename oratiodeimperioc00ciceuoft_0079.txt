3 ox sermone rumor: ⁴ the rumour os common talk) Cf. Cic. Fl.

. 6, 14 sermo est tota Asia dissipatus, Cn. Pompeium, etc. Lucullus
heard the news of Triarius’ defeat at Ziela, not from a survivor of
the field, but through the talk os the natives. See Introd. 11.

26 4 offensione: ‘reverse‚’ ‘check’; cf. 28, l. 4 where the plural is
used.

5 incommodis: a common euphemism for serious disaster. Cf. 33,
l. 33 Ostiense incommodum of the pirates destroying the Roman fleet
in the Roman harbour, as great a disgrace and reverse as when in
1667 the Dutch bumed the shipping in the Medway, and London for
once heard the guns of a hostile fleet.

7 vetere exemplo: Cicero appeals to precedent, but the prorogatio
imperii was no new thing, and he is advocating it in the case ol
Pompey. The appeal is a mere excuse to hide the real reason sor
Lucullus’ recall, the intrigues of his enemies and especially the
equites. See Introd. 10.

8 stipendus confectis erant: ‘had served their time‚’ were emeriti.
Ablative of description, cf. Livy 33, 32 liberos, immunes, suis legi-
bus esse iubet Corinthios. This reading, which is supported by the
Harleian MS„ is to be preferred to consecti, ‘were worn out with
carnpasgnixug-²

Mommsen, vol. lv. p. 63, shows that they were not worn out.
He speaks of them as the two best legions under Lucullus, but they
had served more than their time and had been promised their dis·
charge. See Introd. 6, 10 and 12.
1 1 putem: see note on 1 1, 1. 173 supply sit with sactum.
coniungant: ‘carry on jointly,’ ‘unite in waging.‘
12 integrao: ‘fresh,’ untouched‚ not hitherto involved in the war.
27 14 quare: ‘I think I have said enough (to show) why...’; for the
idiom verba facere quare cf. 39, l. 33, where quem admodum milites
hibernent depends upon sermones ac litterae perferuntur3 this brevity

is foreign to our idiom which makes us insert ‘telling how,’ ‘describ-
ing how.' ’
