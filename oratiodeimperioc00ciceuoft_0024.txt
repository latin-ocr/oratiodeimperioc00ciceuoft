xx DE IMPERIO CN. POMPEL

17. It was clear that the makeshift policy of isolated expedi-
tions, such as that os Servilius to Cilicia, or οἱ Metellus to Crete,
did not meet the case. What was needed was a general fleet sor

that time the resources of the state were placed absolutely at his
disposal. His army was to number 120,000, his fleet 500 ships
