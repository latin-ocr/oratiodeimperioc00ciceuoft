64] NOTES. 75

27 plus tum...v1‹11⁸tis ι ‘ showed more (or deeper) political insight.’
For res publica see note on 8, 1. 27, and for the sense cl. Phil. 2, 15, 39
cum me vidisse plus fateretur, ‘when he admitted that 1 was more
far-seeing.’

30 aliquando: see note on 56, 1. 30.

principes ε the leaders of the Optimates, Catulus and Hortensius
especially.

31 auctoritati parendum: ‘that they must bow to the authority of.’
The double dative sibi...auctoritati is not ambiguous here: see note
on 6, l. 7.

3² Asiatico et reg-lo: ‘in Asia and against kings‚’ both epithets are
intended to suggest ideas of oriental wealth and splendid booty.
Cicero in Ep. ad Q. fr. 1, ι, 19 calls Asia corruptrix provincia, and
he implies that it needs the virtus of a Pompey to resist the tempta-
tions to which an ordinary general would succumb.

1 magnae et multae: cf. 6, l. 4 magna et gravia, and the note
there. Dr Reid in a note on de Amicitia 9, 30 says ‘when two
adjectives are in agreement with the same noun Cicero generally
connects them with et, where English idiom would osten require
them to be put side by side. When multus is one of two adjectives
the conjunction is rarely left out, but if multus is one of three
adjectives the et sometimes disappears,’ e.g. 6, l. 4.

requiruntur: ‘are needed '; cf. 6, l. 6, and 65, l. 12. For the aliae
virtutes see 36,1. 2. Cicero gives a new turn to the argument by
showing the special need for a man of Pompey's moral character in
the province of Asia.

2 interiorum: i.e. Asiae intem'on's.

3 numum imperatorem: see note on 46, l. ¹4·

num fflud : =de nulla alia re.

4 deinde: ‘then too‚’ even if there are any whom a sense of honour

and sels-restraint keeps within bounds.
pudore: like αἰδώς, the sense of shame that keeps a man from doing
wrong. ⁸

5 tales: like τοιούτους must often be rendered more precisely in
English. Our idiom dislikes the vague and colourless ‘such'; say
‘so noble·
